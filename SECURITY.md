# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We currently support the latest minor release series (0.1.x). Security fixes are generally backported at our discretion.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately to security@redb.co. Do not open a public issue.

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours
- Provide a status update within 7 days
- Coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline (typically within 90 days)

## Public disclosure

We will issue a security advisory and update the `CHANGELOG.md` when a fix is released.
